## 💡 How It Works

### 1️⃣ Create an Audience
Define your target demographic with:
- Age range (6 options)
- Gender (5 categories)
- Location
- Interests (13 options, multi-select)
- Income level (5 tiers)

### 2️⃣ Generate Concepts
Select an audience and click generate. The AI creates tailored marketing concepts in seconds:
```
Input: Tech-Savvy Millennials, 25-34, Urban, $75k+
Output: "Smart City Dining Pass - A subscription service that uses 
         predictive analytics to suggest restaurants..."
```

### 3️⃣ Remix & Iterate
Found a concept you like? Remix it to generate creative variations while maintaining the core theme.

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Audiences
```sql
- id: UUID (PK)
- name: TEXT
- age_range: TEXT
- gender: TEXT
- location: TEXT
- interests: TEXT[]
- income_level: TEXT
- created_at: TIMESTAMPTZ
```

### Concepts
```sql
- id: UUID (PK)
- audience_id: UUID (FK → audiences)
- title: TEXT
- description: TEXT
- parent_concept_id: UUID (FK → concepts, nullable)
- created_at: TIMESTAMPTZ
```

**Key Features:**
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- Foreign key constraints for data integrity
- Indexes for performance
- Self-referential relationship for remixes

## 📝 Key Decisions

### Why Next.js 14?
Modern App Router provides better performance through Server Components, built-in API routes for secure LLM integration, and excellent TypeScript support.

### Why Supabase?
PostgreSQL with modern DX, built-in RLS for security, real-time capabilities for future features, and array types perfect for storing interests.

### Why shadcn/ui?
Components are owned (not npm dependencies), built on Radix UI (accessible), highly customizable, and Tailwind CSS integrated.

### Why OpenAI GPT-3.5?
Good balance of quality and cost, JSON mode ensures consistent outputs, fast response times, and reliable availability.
